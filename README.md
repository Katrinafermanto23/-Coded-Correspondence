**Coded Correspondence**

This project simulates a playful exchange of coded messages with a pen pal, the purpose of this project is to create a code to decode some of these messages. 

Project Goals:
Cryptography Implementation:
- Develop Python functions to encode and decode messages using basic cryptography techniques.
- Explore and potentially implement various encryption/decryption algorithms (e.g., Caesar cipher, substitution cipher).

Message Exchange Simulation:
- Simulate a letter exchange by encoding and decoding messages within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Create a fun and interactive experience of exchanging coded messages with Vishal.

Problem-Solving:
Apply creative problem-solving skills to decipher and create coded messages.
Utilize online resources and documentation to learn and implement new cryptography concepts.

Key Features:
Encryption/Decryption Functions: Well-defined Python functions for encoding and decoding messages.
Interactive Message Exchange: A simulated conversation with Vishal, exchanging coded messages.
Cryptography Exploration: Potential exploration of different cryptography techniques and their implementations.
